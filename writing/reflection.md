### Performance

Did the network's output make sense?  

The output makes sense for us since we used the described model from the website.

How could you adjust weights or activation functions to improve accuracy?  

We should adjust weights better on a given scale and use that scale for bias too.  

What did you notice about how small changes (e.g., weights) affect outcomes?  

Small changes does affect our model since we only work with three inputs. If we would include more inputs the change in the inputs would less affect the output.

### Ethics

One big ethical concern with the loan approval model is data bias. If the data used to train the network has unfair patterns, like past discrimination in loan decisions, the network could repeat those unfair decisions. Features like income or credit score might also unintentionally reflect sensitive factors like race or gender, creating more bias. Another issue is transparency—since it’s not always clear how the network makes decisions, it could be hard to explain why someone’s loan was rejected. This could make the process seem unfair. Also, people with non-traditional financial situations, like freelancers, might be judged unfairly because they don’t fit the standard patterns the network is built to evaluate.
### Reflection

Building and working with the neural network had some easy parts and some tricky parts. The basic setup with input, hidden, and output layers was simple to understand. Seeing how data flows through the layers and how weights affect the results made the process clear. Running the data step-by-step also helped us see how inputs turn into outputs. Using a straightforward activation rule, like a threshold, made the network’s behavior easier to predict.

On the other hand, there were challenges. Adjusting the weights to make the network work better wasn’t easy and took a lot of trial and error. Deciding on the right activation threshold was tough too because it had a big impact on the final decisions. Sometimes the results didn’t make sense based on the inputs, which made it hard to trust the model’s decisions. Finally, as we tried adding more features or layers, the network got more complicated, and it became harder to do all the calculations manually.
